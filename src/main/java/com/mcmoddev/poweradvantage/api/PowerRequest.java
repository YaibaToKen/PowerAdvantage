/**
 * <p>
 * When a power source receives its power update and it has energy to donate, it will scan the 
 * network of connected conduits to ask the power sinks if they want some energy. The sinks respond 
 * to this offer by returning a PowerRequest object (this class). The PowerRequest instance 
 * specifies the priority of the machine in addition to the amount of energy that the sink needs to 
 * fill its energy buffer. The energy if given out to sinks in order from highest priority to lowest 
 * priority. A standard machine should make MEDIUM_PRIORITY requests, while machines with very small 
 * internal buffers should be HIGH_PRIORITY and machines that have large energy buffers should be 
 * LOW_PRIORITY. Batteries (devices that store energy) should use priority level BACKUP_PRIORITY, 
 * which is even lower priority than LOW_PRIORITY and should only grant PowerRequests of 
 * LOW_PRIORITY or higher. 
 * </p>
 * <p>You can create custom priorities by using numbers (range from -127 to 127). The higher the 
 * number, the higher the priority.</p>
