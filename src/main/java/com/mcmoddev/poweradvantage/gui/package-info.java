/**
<p>
This package contains content that is added by PowerAdvantage implementing the PowerAdvantage API. 
If you are writing an add-on mod, use the code in this package for reference, but you should not 
depend on it's implementation details as future updates might change them. For a better way to get 
PowerAdvantage content, look in the <code>cyano.poweradvantage.init</code> package.
</p><p>
Because these classes are not part of the API, they are not well documented. They were only meant 
for the eyes of the mod author(s).
